A collection of C# insipired utility modules to be used directly in your TS/JS based projects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

**Prerequisites**

Please make sure you install:
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

**Installing**

Run ```yarn install```

## Running the tests

Tests are still outstanding :(

## Usage

There are two ways of using this library in your projects:
1. Compiling down the whole Zenith core file and use it as a regular JS library, by including it in your script tags or by bundling it with your own code.
2. Piping the library directly in to your Typescript development flow, this is alittle of the ordinary but it works great when multiple projects require the Zenith library. 

## Built With

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Write Javascript that scales
