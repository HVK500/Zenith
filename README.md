# Zenith

A collection of .NET inspired utility modules to be used directly in your TS/JS based projects.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

Please make sure you install:
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

**Installing development modules**

Run ``yarn install``

## Running the tests

Tests are still outstanding :(

## Usage

There are two ways of using this library in your projects:

1. Compiling down the whole Zenith core file and use it as a regular JS library, by including it in your script tags or by bundling it with your own code.
2. Piping the library directly in to your Typescript development flow, this is alittle of the ordinary but it works great when multiple projects require the Zenith library.
